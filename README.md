#Health Hackathon (For Detecting Early onset of depression)

Welcome to our innovative platform dedicated to early detection of depression, crafted with care and expertise by our team for the Weal Health Hackathon. In today's fast-paced world, mental health awareness is more crucial than ever, and our mission is to provide a solution that empowers individuals to take proactive steps towards their well-being.

Our website utilizes a blend of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience. With a focus on accessibility and ease of use, our platform aims to reach a wide audience and offer valuable insights into one's mental health.

We are also planning to integrate the chatbot in the same website which we had built during the Hackathon. 

NOTE : It is important to run this code on a system which has a gpu or use other services like Google Colab, Jupyter notebook, etc which offer resources like gpu.
